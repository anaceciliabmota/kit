# Iterated Local Search for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This repository contains an implementation of **Iterated Local Search (ILS)** to solve instances of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**. The algorithm is designed to iteratively improve solutions by applying local search and perturbation strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Instances

The [`instances/`](instances/) folder contains `.tsp` problem instances used for testing. These files define the cities and distances between them, which the algorithm uses to compute solutions.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The results of different TSP instances are stored in [`results.txt`](results.txt). This file contains information such as:
- Instance tested
- Objective value found
- Execution time
